If you're used to working on High Performance Computing (HPC, or "on prem" servers) you'll likely need to transfer files from your institutional computing resource.

You can check out [this Terra documentation](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/10206456029083-How-to-install-gcloud-on-a-local-machine) for the most recent information. There's also great documentation about moving data to/from Google buckets [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/4409101169051-How-to-move-data-to-from-a-Google-bucket).

First, you'll want to install Google Cloud SDK to make sure you have the software that enables transfer. Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Your code on your institutional server will look something like this:

```
wget https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-447.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xf google-cloud-cli-447.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
gcloud init
```

You might need to specify the path to the executeable `gcloud`, e.g., `google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init`.

Initiating `gcloud` should tell you to copy and paste a long link in your browser.

```
Go to the following link in your browser:

    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response....
    
Enter authorization code:
```

Confirm that Google Cloud SDK can have access. Copy and paste the authorization code from your browser to your server terminal.

```
This account has a lot of projects! Listing them all can take a while.
 [1] Enter a project ID
 [2] Create a new project
 [3] List projects
Please enter your numeric choice:
```

Select `1` to enter your Workspace's Google Project ID. You can find this on the Workspace dashboard tab. It will be something like `terra-123abcefg`.

Confirm you are in the right place by typing in the following, replacing `terra-123abcefg` with your Google Project ID. The command should return the Bucket name.

```
gsutil ls -p terra-123abcefg
```

Now you're ready to copy data over with `gsutil cp`! Replace the `/data/user_name/data_folder` with the directory on your server. Replace `gs://fc-a1b2c3` with your Bucket name. Note that the `-r` flag is "recursive", which means all files in that directory will be moved over.

```
gsutil cp -r /data/user_name/data_folder gs://fc-a1b2c3
```
