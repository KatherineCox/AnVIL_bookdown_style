If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, [create one now](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow [these instructions](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611).

Next, make sure you can log in to Terra -- you will use Terra to perform computations on AnVIL. You can access Terra by going to [`anvil.terra.bio`](https://anvil.terra.bio/). Open Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account.
