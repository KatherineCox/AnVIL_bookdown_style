To help users report issues or areas of improvement for your course, you should provide a clear method of feedback for your users to route their concerns through.

[See these instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Set-up-feedback-method) for suggestions on how to add a feedback method for this course. 

_Fred Hutch Courses_: A feedback method (Google Form) has already been provided. When users give you feedback they can enter the name of your course. You can make it easier for them by adding the course to form here: https://forms.gle/SUzhmVkUaRbsrnaD7.
