## OTTR updates

The original template: https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template is always a work in progress.
We are working on adding more features and smoothing out bugs as we go.

If you want to receive updates from the original template to your course template, you will need to enroll this repository to the template updates by adding it to the `sync.yml` file.

- [ ] [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Start-a-new-course#9-enroll-your-repository-for-ottr-updates) to enroll your course repository to receive these updates.

- [ ] [Ensure that you have followed these instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Start-a-new-course#5-add-jhudsl-robot-as-a-collaborator) to add the `jhudsl-robot` as a collaborator to your repository.  (You can skip this step if your course is in the jhudsl organization.)


## AnVIL updates

In addition to OTTR updates, AnVIL books and courses should subscribe for updates from the AnVIL_Template.  The OTTR_Template provides most of the rendering functionality; the AnVIL_Template provides anything AnVIL specific (e.g. styling, adding the list of existing AnVIL books).
